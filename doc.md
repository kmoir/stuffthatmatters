# Mass Incarceration and the Prison-industrial Complex


## Introduction

*It’s a system marred by vast racial disparities – one that stigmatizes and targets young black men for arrest at a young age, unfairly punishes communities of color, burdens taxpayers and exacts a tremendous social cost. Today, African-American men who failed to finish high school are more likely to be behind bars than employed.* <sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>

*In Canada, the Indigenous incarceration rate is 10 times higher than the non-Indigenous population--higher even than South Africa at the height of Apartheid.* <sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup>
 
*perhaps should mention the history of mass incarceration and how it has shifted from social justice to punishment
*need some personal stories of people that have been incarcerated along with the facts and numbers
*maybe I should mention "Thinking in Systems", inputs are poverty, incarceration, lost income, disenfranchisement.  Impact of police forces having equipment funded by high number of drug seizures.

###introduction - should actually write it last because now it is very weak
For many people, the police are seen as a force for good and serve in their role to protect their communities from harm.  But that it a sentiment that is not shared by many communities for many reasons that are readily apparent given their lived experiences.  Stop and frisk efforts disproportionally target Black, Latinx, and Indigenous people.  Despite having similiar rates of illicit drug use and sale, these same groups of people are charged and incarcerated for these offenses at a much higher rate than white people.  The impact of these communities are devastating. Higher incarceration rates mean parents aren''t able to work to support their families.  (mention associated reduction in tax revenues that impact schools?)  Many states prevent those with felony records from voting, which disenfranchises swatches of the population from exercising their democratic right to cast a ballot.  It also prevents these same people from electing officials in their communities who will pursue criminal justice reform, thus continuing the cycle of poverty, incarceration, lost income and again disenfranchisement. 

With signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, discrimination based on race, colour, religion, sex or national origin was outlawed. *<sup>[3](#myfootnote3)</sup> It ended racially segregated schools
and different voter registration requirements based on skin colour. In theory.  In practice, discrimination continued to flourish, especially in the criminal justice system .  If you could not legally discriminate against people based on race, but you can still discriminate against them based on their felony status.  Felons can be legally denied applications for housing, voting rights, educational opportunties, public benefits such as food stamps or the ability to apply for a job. Many employers refuse to hire those with a felony record, and there is not legal recourse for this type of discrimation (citation needed) 

* ..I came to see that mass incarceration in the United States, had in fact, emerged as a stunningly comprehensive and well-disguised system of racialized social control that functions in a manner similar to Jim Crow* <sup>[4](#myfootnote4)</sup>

In American culture, it is a common refrain that anyone can become financially sucessful if they work hard.  But if your communities and families have their economic, educational and voting opportunities curtailed by mass incarceration, these opportunties for advancement simply do not exist. 

Some state legislatures have recently reduced sentences for drug offences. This is not due to concern for the people impacted by these harsh drug laws, but rather an attempt to reduce the large scale prison costs associated with incarerating so many people. The impact of reduced sentences does little to improve the prospects of the people who return to their communities after being incarcerated as they still have the felony convication on their record which allows housing and employment discrimination,  and an inability to vote for the remainder of their lives.

*History of the shift from social welfare to punitive intervention (started with Johnson)

*When Johnson introduced a comprehensive anti-poverty program in low-income urban communities for the first time while simultaneously launching an anticrime intervention, the balance tilted from social welfare to punishment as the national law enforcement program crowded out the goals of the poverty war.*<sup>[3](#myfootnote3)</sup>

#not sure if I should include all the history from Johnson on. Reagan (war on drugs) and Clinton (welfare changes) seem more significant

The number of people incarcerated for drug offenses has risen an astonishing amount since the beginning of the War on Drugs in the 1980s. Drug arrests have tripled since 1980 and moreJJ than 31 million people have been incarerated since the War on Drugs began.  <sup>[7](#myfootnote5)</sup>  The common thinking is that aim of the War on Drugs was to reduce the number of large distributors.  However, this is not the case and the vast majority of arrests are for possession, not distribution.  This increase in the number of prisoners has also led to a huge increase in the number of prisons built.   How did this happen?

The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects against unreasonable search and seizure.  However, this has been ignored by the courts when it comes to unreasonable searches of people for drugs.  In addition, police officers have also usused "pretext stops". For example, stopping a car for a minor driving infraction such as a broken tailight or failing to signal when turning could be used a pretext stop.  Once the drivers is stopped by the police officer, the car and the people within it are searched for drugs.  This despite the fact that the police officers have no existing evidence that the motorist may be in posession of any illegal drugs.  The pretext stops have been held up by the Supreme Court - the police are free to stop a person for a traffic violation and then search for drugs, even though they have no existing evidence of drug related activity.  <sup>[8](#myfootnote8)</sup>  This has been a long standing approach by law enforcement.  In fact, in 1984 as part of the rollout of the War on Drugs, the DEA launched a training program called Operation Pipeline to use these same pretext traffic stops to search cars for drugs.
<sup>[9](#myfootnote9)</sup> 

At the beginning of the War on Drugs, drug use was actually declining. So police officers needed a motivation to start to arrest people for drug offences versus offences against property or person.  At the time, there was not widespread agreement that 
the drug offences should be the top priority among state and local enforcement.  This incentive to change their position was additional federal funding.  In 1988, the Reagan administration revised the program that provided federal aid, calling it the Byrn program.  The funding was designed to help encourage recipients to fight the war on drugs, including building more narcotics task forces, including those that stop people on the highway with the same pretext stops mentioned above.  The additional funding also allowed local police forces to buy military grade hardware to patrol their streets.  The police forces need a reason to use this new shiny hardware, and thus the prevalence of SWAT (Special Weapons and Tactics) raids for drug offences became myore common.  SWAT teams inflict sudden, unannouced and forced entries into a residence.  It is teriffying for the residents within.  SWAT raids have resulted in a number of innocent bystanders being killed, as well as those who have had no-involvement in the drug trade, but were the result of mistaken identity or the wrong address for a raid. 
<sup>[10](#myfootnote10)</sup> 

In addition to the additional federal funding for equipment for SWAT teams, and training for using traffic stops as a pretext to search a vehicle for drugs, the Reagan administration introduced a new financial incentive to the war on drugs: Forfeiture.  Police departs could keep the vast majority of cash and assets that were seized during drug operations. This allowed them to further expand the number of officers they could hire, the equipment they could buy, which is turn encouraged more drug arrests.  There was also very little recourse for those who had their assets seized.  The probable cause was very low for the police to prove that the assets were indeed related to a drug crime. The people who had assets seized usually had limited income and thus didn''t have the means to pay a lawyer''s fees to attempt to get their property returned in court.
