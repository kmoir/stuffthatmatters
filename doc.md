# Mass Incarceration and the Prison-industrial Complex


## Introduction

*It’s a system marred by vast racial disparities – one that stigmatizes and targets young black men for arrest at a young age, unfairly punishes communities of color, burdens taxpayers and exacts a tremendous social cost. Today, African-American men who failed to finish high school are more likely to be behind bars than employed.* <sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>

*In Canada, the Indigenous incarceration rate is 10 times higher than the non-Indigenous population--higher even than South Africa at the height of Apartheid.* <sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup>
 
#perhaps should mention the history of mass incarceration and how it has shifted from social justice to punishment


#maybe I should mention "Thinking in Systems", inputs are poverty, incareration, lost income, disenfranchisement.  Impact of police forces having equipment funded by high number of drug seizures.

For many people, the police are seen as a force for good, to protect their communities from harm.  But that it a sentiment that is not shared by many communities, and for good reason.  Stop and frisk efforts disproportionally target Black, Latinx, and Indigenous people.  Despite having similiar rates of illicit drug use and sale, these same groups of people are charged and incarcerated for these offenses at a much higher rate than white people.  The impact of these communities are devastating. Higher incarceration rates mean parents aren''t able to work to support their families.  (mention associated reduction in tax revenues that impact schools?)  Many states prevent those with felony records from voting, which disenfranchises swatches of the population from exercising their democratic right.  It also prevents these same people from electing officials in their communities who will pursue criminal justice reform, thus continuing the cycle of poverty, incareration, lost income, disenfranchisement. 


*History of the shift from social welfare to punitive intervention (started with Johnson)

*When Johnson introduced a comprehensive anti-poverty program in low-income urban communities for the first time while simultaneously launching an anticrime intervention, the balance tilted from social welfare to punishment as the national law enforcement program crowded out the goals of the poverty war.*<sup>[3](#myfootnote3)</sup>
