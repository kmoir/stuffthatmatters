# Mass Incarceration and the Prison-Industrial Complex


## Introduction

*It’s a system marred by vast racial disparities – one that stigmatizes and targets young black men for arrest at a young age, unfairly punishes communities of color, burdens taxpayers and exacts a tremendous social cost. Today, African-American men who failed to finish high school are more likely to be behind bars than employed.* <sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>

*In Canada, the Indigenous incarceration rate is 10 times higher than the non-Indigenous population--higher even than South Africa at the height of Apartheid.* <sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup>
 
* todo - perhaps should mention the history of mass incarceration and how it has shifted from social justice to punishment
* todo - need some personal stories of people that have been incarcerated along with the facts and numbers
* todo - maybe I should mention "Thinking in Systems", inputs are poverty, incarceration, lost income, disenfranchisement.  Impact of police forces having equipment funded by high number of drug seizures.

* todo - should write intro last

For many people, the police are seen as a force for good and serve in their role to protect their communities from harm.   Despite having comparable rates of illegal drug use, people of colour people are charged and incarcerated for drug offenses at a much higher rate than white people.  The impact of these communities are devastating. Higher incarceration rates mean parents aren''t able to work to support their families.  (mention associated reduction in tax revenues that impact schools?)  Many states prevent those with felony records from voting, which disenfranchises swatches of the population from exercising their democratic right to cast a ballot.  It also prevents them from serving on juries or electing officials in their communities who will pursue criminal justice reform, thus continuing the cycle of poverty, incarceration, lost income and again disenfranchisement. 

With signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in the United States, discrimination based on race, colour, religion, sex or national origin was outlawed.  <sup>[3](#myfootnote3)</sup> It ended racially segregated schools and different voter registration requirements based on skin colour.  In theory.  In practice, discrimination continued to flourish, especially in the criminal justice system.  If you could not legally discriminate against people based on race, but you can still discriminate against them based on their felony status.  Felons can be legally denied applications for housing, voting rights, educational opportunties, public benefits such as food stamps or the ability to apply for a job. Many employers refuse to hire those with a felony record, and there is not legal recourse for this type of discrimation (citation needed) 

* ..I came to see that mass incarceration in the United States, had in fact, emerged as a stunningly comprehensive and well-disguised system of racialized social control that functions in a manner similar to Jim Crow* <sup>[4](#myfootnote4)</sup>

In American culture, it is a common refrain that anyone can become financially sucessful if they work hard.  But if your communities and families have their economic, educational and voting opportunities curtailed by mass incarceration, these opportunties for advancement simply do not exist. 

* move this to summary
Some state legislatures have recently reduced sentences for drug offences. This is not due to concern for the people impacted by these harsh drug laws, but rather an attempt to reduce the large scale prison costs associated with incarerating so many people. The impact of reduced sentences does little to improve the prospects of the people who return to their communities after being incarcerated as they still have a felony conviction on their record which allows housing and employment discrimination, and an inability to vote for the remainder of their lives.

*History of the shift from social welfare to punitive intervention (started with Johnson)

*When Johnson introduced a comprehensive anti-poverty program in low-income urban communities for the first time while simultaneously launching an anticrime intervention, the balance tilted from social welfare to punishment as the national law enforcement program crowded out the goals of the poverty war.*<sup>[3](#myfootnote3)</sup>


* todo - not sure if I should include all the history from Johnson on. Reagan (War on Drugs) and Clinton (welfare changes) seem more significant

The number of people incarcerated for drug offenses has risen an astonishing amount since the beginning of the War on Drugs in the 1980s. Drug arrests have tripled since 1980 and more than 31 million people have been incarerated since the War on Drugs began.  <sup>[7](#myfootnote5)</sup>  The common thinking is that aim of the War on Drugs was to reduce the number of large distributors.  However, this is not the case and the vast majority of arrests are for possession, not distribution.  This increase in the number of prisoners has also led to a huge increase in the number of prisons built.   How did this happen?

The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects against unreasonable search and seizure.  However, this has been ignored by the courts when it comes to unreasonable searches of people for drugs.  In addition, police officers use "pretext stops". For example, stopping a car for a minor driving infraction such as a broken taillight or failing to signal when turning could be used a pretext stop.  Once the driver is stopped by the police officer, the car and its occupants are searched for drugs.  The search proceeds despite the fact that the police officers have no existing evidence that the motorist may be in posession of any illegal drugs.  The pretext stops have been held up by the Supreme Court - the police are free to stop a person for a traffic violation and then search for drugs, even though they have no existing evidence of drug related activity.  <sup>[8](#myfootnote8)</sup>  This has been a long standing approach by law enforcement.  In fact, in 1984 as part of the rollout of the War on Drugs, the DEA launched a training program called Operation Pipeline to coach officers on how to employ this method.
<sup>[9](#myfootnote9)</sup> 

At the beginning of the War on Drugs, drug use was actually declining. So police officers needed a motivation to start to arrest people for drug offences versus offences against property or person.  At the time, there was not widespread agreement that the drug offences should be the top priority among state and local enforcement.  This incentive to change their position was additional federal funding.  In 1988, the Reagan administration revised the program that provided federal aid, calling it the Byrn program.  The funding was designed to help encourage recipients to fight the War on Drugs, including building more narcotics task forces, including those that stop people on the highway with the same pretext stops mentioned above.  The additional funding also allowed local police forces to buy military grade hardware to patrol their streets.  The police forces need a reason to use this new shiny hardware, and thus the prevalence of SWAT (Special Weapons and Tactics) raids for drug offences became myore common.  SWAT teams inflict sudden, unannounced and forced entries into a residence.  It is teriffying for the residents within.  SWAT raids have resulted in a number of innocent bystanders being killed, as well as those who have had no-involvement in the drug trade, but were the result of mistaken identity or the wrong address for a raid. 
<sup>[10](#myfootnote10)</sup> 

In addition to the additional federal funding for equipment for SWAT teams, and training for using traffic stops as a pretext to search a vehicle for drugs, the Reagan administration introduced a new financial incentive to the War on Drugs: Forfeiture.  Police departs could keep the vast majority of cash and assets that were seized during drug operations. This allowed them to further expand the number of officers they could hire and the equipment they could buy. Larger police departments with more equipment allowed them to stop more people and check their vehicles for drugs.  There was also very little recourse for those who had their assets seized.  The probable cause was very low for the police to prove that the assets were indeed related to a drug crime. It was up to the people who had their assets seized to prove their innocence.  The people who had assets seized often had limited income and thus didn''t have the means to pay a lawyer''s fees to attempt to get their property returned in court.  Those who did have the income available to hire counsel could, including those higher up in the drug distribution chain, were less likely to earn sentences because they had the means to hire representation.  The end result was that people who were charged with possession, or small amounts for trafficing were more likely to haver longer prison sentences than those with the means to pay a lawyer.  
<sup>[11](#myfootnote11)</sup> 

Forfeiture of property as a result of supected involvement in drug crimes was an appproach allowed police departments to significantly increase their budgets.  In 2000, the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act was passed by Congress to address these issues, including shifting the burden of proof to the government in the case of forfeiture, removing the restriction that the owner post bond, and allocating protections for innocent people who could have lost their homes.  However, it did not address the root of the problem with linking forfeiture and drug arrests: profit for police departments.  This per profit motive that allows police departments to grow their size in terms of people and equipment provides a strong incentive to continue to increase drug arrests that lead to prison time. 
<sup>[12](#myfootnote12)</sup> 

* should mention fines on people as a way to bolster city revenues i.e. Ferguson? 

From the American Bar Association, 

*Far from ensuring that individuals are afforded a meaningful right to counsel, current indigent defense systems often operate at substandard levels and provide woefully inadequate representation.  Witnesses described programs bereft of the funding and resources necessary to afford even the most basic tools essential for an effective defense.  As a result, literally thousands of accused poor persons who are unable to afford counsel routinely are denied, either entirely or in part, meaningful legal representation.  Too often when attorneys are provided, crushing workloads make it impossible for them to devote sufficient time to their cases, leading to widespread breaches of professional obligations.  To make matters worse, exceedingly modest compensation deters private attorneys from per forming more than the bare minimum required for payment.  Further, the structure of indigent defense systems often means that judges and/or state and county officials control the attorneys, thereby denying them the professional independence afforded to their prosecution counterparts and to their colleagues retained by paying clients.  Taken as whole, glaring deficiencies in indigent defense ser vices result in a fundamentally unfair criminal justice system that constantly risks convicting persons who are genuinely innocent of the charges lodged against them.* <sup>[12](#myfootnote12)</sup>

Justice is not colourblind. The use and sale of illegal drugs is done at remarkably consistent rates across races.  However, there are stark differences in  the rate at which people are labelled a felon or sent to prison.  The number of Black Americans incarcerated for drug crimes has increased more than twenty six times from 1983 to 2000, twenty two times for Latinx groups, and eight times for whites. pg 98 Despite this, Human Rights watch reports that this same year, white youth are much more likely to sell or possess illegal drugs.  In addition, white youth visit the emergency room for drug related visits at a rate of three times those of their black counterparts. p 99 However, the image portrayed by the media is that drug use and sale an affliction of communities of colour, despite concrete evidence to the contrary. 
The numbers large numbers of people of colour labelled a felon, or subsequently imprisioned is a result of racial bias. Racial bias when conducting stop and frisk, and traffic stops.  Racial bias in the the justice system.  For instance, statistical analysis of sentencing in Georgia demonstrated that blacks where 4.3 times more likely to receive the death sentence for a murder conviction that whites that were found guilty of the same crime. p110 There is also discrimation in jury selection, it is easy for prosecutors to select all white juries. p 120t

p 133 racial profiling in policing  as well as whites more likely to carry contraband in cars

To recap, pretext stops allowed police officers to stop individuals for a minor traffic infraction as a pretext stop.  Once the vehicle was stopped, they were allowed to search the car for drugs, despite lacking any evidence that there were any drugs in the car.  The Supreme Court upheld that this was not a violation of the Fourth Amendment to unreasonable search and seizure.  More federal funding for additonal state and local police officers and military grade equipment to fight the War on Drugs led to an increase in drug arrests.  As well, forfeiture of the assets of people charged with drug posession or distribtion provided a strong incentive to continue to increase their drug arrests.  The result was an large increase in the number of people charged with drug crimes. Many were indigent, and did not have the means to pay for counsel.  The caseload for public defenders is high, they are poorly compensated and many provide inadequate representation for their clients.  The end result is many more people in prison.

To cope with the growth in prison populations due to the War on Drugs, the federal government outsourced the operation of some prisons to private companies, such as Corrections Corporation of America, now called CoreCivic.  The shift to private prisons shifted the goal to lower prison costs as much as possible, to generate the highest profits possible for shareholders and company executives. Contracts for private prisons are negotiated on a per-diem basis, with a set cost per day per prisoner for healthcare, food and accommodations.  There have been several cases that have come to light where prisoners have received the health care they need, because these private prisons are unwilling to pay for required health care. For instance, the unsurprising outcome was that care for prisoners was reduced in private prisons, with devastating results.  For instance, the South Bend Tribune describes the case of a tort claim filed by civil rights attorney Micheal Sutherland against the Indiana Women''s prison: 

*The prisoner, Tiffany Smith, described in a letter the events that began with excruciating pain, nausea, and a large knot that emerged on the right side of her abdomen, where her skin had turned black. The 35-year-old said even guards remarked on the lack of medical response to what turned out to be a ruptured appendix.*  

*After a first emergency surgery, Smith wrote, the surgeon said her body cavity was filled with the most infection he had ever seen. After several days in an ICU, she was dismissed back to the prison infirmary with prescriptions and strict instructions about wound care, which she alleges were not followed.*

*Near death again, Smith and the tort claim allege, she was rushed back to a hospital for emergency surgery, where “the surgeon had to remove my organs, wash the infection off of them, and put them back.”*

*The tort claim describes several instances in which guards and some medical staff insisted Smith be sent to a hospital but were overruled by a doctor — for a common condition that “is also easy to diagnose if the proper steps are taken.”*

Per profit prisons need more and more prisons to be built to keep their profits growing.  These corporations profits depend on more arrests, and longer sentences upon conviction to keep their business to grow.  Also, with their primary incentive is their own profit, not reducing the recidisvism rate through educational or vocational traiing programs.  They are optimized to sweep as much profit from taxpapers for their services, while there are few incentives to improve the living conditions of prisoners, or to reduce the chance they will return to prison.

In August 2016, Deputy Attorney Sally Yates released a memo indicating that the US Justice department would stop using private prisons due to reports that they do not have the same level of safety or quality as those run by the Bureau of Corrections.  The aim was to let contracts with private prisons run their course and not be renewed.  Unfortunately, this directive was rescinded byt the subsequent adminstration so the health and living conditions of prisoners in private prisons will continue to be substandard substandard to that offered by the Bureau of Corrections.
<sup>[30](#myfootnote30)</sup> 


The Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution abolished slavery and involuntary servitude.  There is one exception - as punishment for a crime.  The result of this is that prisoners can be forced to work, and paid nothing, or a few pennies an hour.   

*More than a century later, our prison labor system has only grown. We now incarcerate more than 2.2 million people, with the largest prison population in the world, and the second highest incarceration rate per capita. Our prison populations remain racially skewed. With few exceptions, inmates are required to work if cleared by medical professionals at the prison. Punishments for refusing to do so include solitary confinement, loss of earned good time, and revocation of family visitation. For this forced labor, prisoners earn pennies per hour, if anything at all.*
<sup>[31](#myfootnote31)</sup> 

Companies that have used prison labour include Victoria''s Secret to sew underwear, mining industries, manufacturing including manufacturing military weapons.  In addition, some call centres are staffed by prisoners.  The tech industry has also been implicated in using prison labour:

*In the mid-1990s, Washington prisoners shrink-wrapped software and up to 20,000 Microsoft mouses for subcontractor Exmark (other reported clients: Costco and JanSport). "We don''t see this as a negative," a Microsoft spokesman said at the time. Dell used federal prisoners for PC recycling in 2003, but stopped after a watchdog group warned that it might expose inmates to toxins.*
<sup>[32](#myfootnote32)</sup> 

Not only are their wages unfair, they are not protected by labour codes that protect workers on the outside.  Their labour is outsourced to many companies who reap handome profits from slave wages.*


p 143
upon leaving prison, the person may not be be able to vote for a certain period of time or forever, be unable to qualify for some types of employment, public housing, federally funded health benefits, food stamps, educational benefits.  Judges are not under obligation to inform people that they will lose these rights when they plead out to a felony.  Once they leave the prison, they will need a place to stay.  One of the tenants of HUD (Housing and Urban Development) One Strike guide is that if you have any convictions for any crimes, you can be denied housing.  This also applies to people who stay with you in public housing.  So often people are reluctant to let relatives stay with them after they have recently left prison to mitigate the chance that they will lose their housing.  If you are charged with a minor drug crime, you can lose your housing, which may lead you to lose custody of your children to foster care because you are homeless.  ""A study conducted by the McCormick Institute of Public Affairs found that nearly a quarter of gues at homeless shelters had been incarcerated within the previous year--people who were unable to find somewhere else to live after release from prison walls""p147
 
 




Summary:

Mass Incareration marginalizes predomininately black, Latinx and Indigeneous people from participating fully in society.  

To further exacerbate the issues of representation in court, some juridictions don''t have enough public defender lawyers to support those who need these services.  
<sup>[20](#myfootnote20)</sup> (this info is from a much later date than 1980s, perhaps would be good for summary)

Richardson v. Ramirez, 418 U.S. 24 (1974), held that convicted felons could be barred from voting without violating the Fourteenth Amendment.
