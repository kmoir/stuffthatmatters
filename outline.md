# The chapter on mass incarceration and the prison-industrial complex
# for http://third-bit.com/2016/11/13/stuff-that-actually-matters.html

Outline
This is a brief outline of the topics I intend to cover.  I have done quite a bit of reading on mass incareration in the US and Canada.  I thought I would limit the scope to these countries.  I''m not sure if I should give examples of countries that take a more social justice approach to imprisonment as a contrast or just state the reasons why the current systems in place are so broken.  I''ll include references to all the statistics I include in the actual book chapter, but here are some concepts I''d like to cover.  

- USA specific
*  History of the shift from social welfare to punitive intervention (started with Johnson) From reference (1) page 14 below ""When Johnson introduced a comprehensive antipoverty program in low-income urban communities for the first time while simultaneously launching an anticrime intervention, the balance tilted from social welfar to punishment as the national law enforcement program crowded out the goals of the poverty war.""
* Black men have a much higher arrest rate, incareration rate, and longer sentences in prison due to systematic rascism and racial profiling by police. i.e. stop and frisk stops more black men but white men have comparable rates of consuming/selling drugs (reference (2))
* How the war on drugs provides a source of funds for police departments which encourages them to seek more arrests (started with Reagan)
* Militerization of police forces with military grade hardware (page 65 in reference (1)
* Impact of a felony conviction on disenfranchishment of voters, especially in black, Latino and Native American communuities. Lack of representation to have their voices heard. Depending on the state, some are disenfranchised for life, some are unable to vote until they pay a series of fees (reference (2))
* For profit prisons - Again, the profit incentive encourages more arrests, longer convictions and their is no incentive to implement programs (educational, vocational and so on) to reduce recidivism rates. (reference (2))
* How a felony conviction can continue the cycle of poverty by due to the fees an inmate must pay  associated with leaving prison (reference (2))
* Impact on having a parent in prison in the children of inmates (reference (6)
* The consequences of having police officers in schools addressing student behaviour problems (school to prison pipeline)
* Three strikes and you''re out rules
* Loss of middle class wages for people with high school educations due to automation of work in factories, closing factories in urban centres.  Underfunded schools could not prepare ststudents for more highly skilled jobs in growing industries like engineering, aerospace (page 67 in reference (1)


- Canada specific 
* Indegenous people are incarcerated due to a much higher rate than other groups in Canada.  (Talk about the history and impact of residential schools, underfunding of reserves (lack clean water, schools that meet the same educational standards and funding as schools in southern Canada)  (reference (6)
* Solidary confinement is supposed to be in limited use but recent examples have shown that is is not (reference (7))
* 

Both countries
* mandatory minimum
* evidence of what actually reduces recidivisim
* impact of solidary confinement on mental health
* overcrowding in prisons
* lack of funding for educational initiatives and programs to reduce addictions in prison
* links between childhood abuse, drug abus and subsquent incarceration
* criminal justice reform
* drug addiction in many cases is treated as a moral failure that requires a prison sentence when instead it should be treated as a public health issue. Implementation of policies for harm reduction for people with substance abuse issues vs imprisonment have better outcomes

Topics that perhaps are relevant
* Welfare reform under Clinton (put time limits on people receiving benefits, hurt mostly single mothers, vilified single mothers on welfare, the reality was low wage jobs that didn''t provide health care made it very difficult to survive)
