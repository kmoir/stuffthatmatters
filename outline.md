# for http://third-bit.com/2016/11/13/stuff-that-actually-matters.html

Outline

- USA specific
- History of the shift frm social welfare to punitive intervention (started with Johnson)
* Black men have a much higher arrest rate, incareration rate, and longer sentences in prison due to systematic rascism and racial profiling by police
* How the war on drugs provides a source of funds for police departments which encourages them to seek more arrests (started with Reagan)
* Welfare reform under Clinton vilified those on social assistance and further 
* Militerization of police forces with military grade hardware
* Impact of a felony conviction on disenfranchishment of voters, especially in black, Latino and Native American communuities. Lack of representation to have their voices heard. Depending on the state, some are disenfranchised for life, some are unable to vote until they pay a series of fees
* For profit prisons - Again, the profit incentive encourages more arrests, longer convictions and their is no incentive to implement programs (educational, vocational and so on) to reduce recidivism rates.
* How a felony conviction can continue the cycle of poverty by due to the fees an inmate must pay  associated with leaving prison
* Impact on having a parent in prison in the children of inmates
* The consequences of having police officers in schools addressing student behaviour problems (school to prison pipeline)
* Three strikes and you''re out rules, mandatory mininums 

- Canada specific 
* Indegenous people are incarcerated due to a much higher rate than other groups in Canada.  (Talk about the history and impact of residential schools, underfunding of reserves (lack clean water, schools that meet the same educational standards and funding as schools in southern Canada)

Both countries
* mandatory minimums
* evidence of what actually reduces recidivisim
* impact of solidary confinement on mental health
* overcrowding in prisons
* criminal justice reform
