# Mass Incarceration and the Prison-Industrial Complex

From the Southern Poverty Law Center:

*It’s a system marred by vast racial disparities – one that stigmatizes and targets young black men for arrest at a young age, unfairly punishes communities of color, burdens taxpayers and exacts a tremendous social cost. Today, African-American men who failed to finish high school are more likely to be behind bars than employed.* <sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>

From the Atlantic article "A Blueprint to End Mass Incarceration":<sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup>

*Much of the debate surrounding mass incarceration is centered on its statistics: The United States has 5 percent of the world’s population and 25 percent of its prisoners; American prisons hold more inmates than Soviet gulags at their peak; a greater proportion of black Americans are imprisoned than black South Africans under apartheid.*<sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup>

For many, the police are a force for good that serve and protect their neighbourhoods.  For communities that have been disproportionately incarcerated and subject to police brutality, however, the police are a source of fear.  Despite having comparable rates of illegal drug use, people of colour are charged and incarcerated for drug offenses at a much higher rate than whites.  The impact is devastating. Higher incarceration rates mean families are separated and parents aren&#x27;t able to work to support their children. 

With signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in the United States, discrimination based on race, colour, religion, sex or national origin was outlawed.<sup>[3](#myfootnote3)</sup> In theory, it ended racially segregated schools and different voter registration requirements based on skin colour.  In practice, discrimination continued to flourish, especially in the criminal justice system.  You could not legally discriminate against people based on their race, but you could still discriminate against them based on their felony status.  

People with felony convictions can be legally denied voting rights, educational opportunities, applications for housing and public benefits such as food stamps and welfare.  It is legal for employers to discriminate against those hiring candidates with a felony conviction; this increases poverty and the rates of recidivism.  Many states prevent those with felony records from voting, which disenfranchises swatches of the population from exercising their democratic right to cast a ballot.  This in turn, also prevents them from serving on juries or electing officials in their communities who will pursue criminal justice reform.


From the book "The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness" by Michelle Alexander:

* ..I came to see that mass incarceration in the United States, had in fact, emerged as a stunningly comprehensive and well-disguised system of racialized social control that functions in a manner similar to Jim Crow* <sup>[4](#myfootnote4)</sup>

In American culture, it is a common refrain that anyone can become financially successful if they work hard; however, if your communities and families have their economic, educational and voting opportunities curtailed by mass incarceration, these opportunities for advancement simply do not exist.

*When (President) Johnson introduced a comprehensive anti-poverty program in low-income urban communities for the first time while simultaneously launching an anticrime intervention, the balance tilted from social welfare to punishment as the national law enforcement program crowded out the goals of the poverty war.*<sup>[3](#myfootnote3)</sup>

The number of people incarcerated for drug offenses has skyrocketed since the War on Drugs began in earnest with the first term of the Reagan administration. Drug arrests have tripled since 1980;more than 31 million people have been incarcerated since the War on Drugs began.  <sup>[7](#myfootnote5)</sup>  The War on Drugs was marketed as a way reduce the number of high volume distributors; however, this is not the case and the vast majority of arrests have been for possession, not distribution.  The increased  number of prisoners has led to a corresponding increase in the number of prisons built.  Where did this begin? 

The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution protects against unreasonable search and seizure; but this has been ignored by the courts when it comes to unreasonable searches for drugs.  Police officers often engage in pretext stops; that is they stop a motorist for a minor driving infraction such as a broken taillight or failing to signal when turning.  Once the driver is stopped, the car and its occupants are searched for drugs.  The search proceeds despite the fact that the police officers may have no pre-existing evidence of drug possession.  The pretext stops have been upheld by the Supreme Court.<sup>[8](#myfootnote8)</sup>  As part of the rollout of the War on Drugs, the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) launched a training program called Operation Pipeline to coach officers on how to employ this method; ever since it has been a long-standing approach by law enforcement.<sup>[9](#myfootnote9)</sup>

When the War on Drugs began, drug use was declining and arrests for drug offences were not the top priority among state and local enforcement. Police officers needed a reason to prioritize arrests for drug offences over offences for against property or person.  This incentive came in the form of additional federal funding.

In 1988, the Reagan administration revised the program that provided federal aid to state and local police, and renamed it the Byrn program.  The funding was designed to encourage recipients to fight the War on Drugs, by building more narcotics task forces, including the same pretext stops described earlier.  It also, enabled local police forces to buy military-grade hardware to patrol their streets.  Police forces need a reason to use this new shiny hardware; thus the prevalence of SWAT (Special Weapons and Tactics) raids for drug offences became more common.  SWAT teams inflict sudden, unannounced and forced entries into a residence,  terrifying its residents.  Unfortunately, there have been raids that resulted in the deaths of innocent bystanders, and individuals not involved in the drug trade, due to mistaken identify or incorrect address.<sup>[10](#myfootnote10)</sup>

The Reagan administration introduced another new financial incentive to the War on Drugs: forfeiture.  Police departments could keep the vast majority of cash and assets that were seized during drug operations so they could increase the number of officers they could hire and the equipment they could buy. The larger and better equipped the police department was, the more motorists they could stop and check their vehicles for drugs.  There was very little recourse for those who had their assets seized.  The required evidence for probable cause was very low for the police to prove that the assets were indeed related to a drug crime. It was up to the accused to prove their innocence, and they could not afford to pay a lawyer to petition to have their property returned.  Those who did, including those higher up in the drug distribution chain.  They were were less likely to receive prison sentences.  The end result was that people who were charged with possession, or small amounts for trafficking were more likely to haver longer prison sentences than those able to pay a lawyer.<sup>[11](#myfootnote11)</sup>

Forfeiture of property as a result of suspected involvement in drug crimes enabled police departments to significantly increase their budgets.  In 2000, the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act was passed by Congress to address these issues, including shifting the burden of proof to the government in the case of forfeiture, removing the restriction that the owner post bond, and allocating protections for innocent people who could have lost their homes.  It did not, however, address the root of the problem with linking forfeiture and drug arrests: profit.  Police departments have a strong incentive to continue to increase drug arrests that lead to prison time. 
<sup>[12](#myfootnote12)</sup> 

Once arrested, most cases never go to trial in exchange for a reduced sentence by plea bargain or leniency.  Mandatory minimums, and three strikes laws have encouraged people to plead out to avoid longer sentences, especially in the case of children charged with crimes.  Prosecutors have enormous power and can dismiss a case or add additional charges at their discretion.<sup>[42](#myfootnote42)</sup> Some sentences for drug offences have longer sentences than those for violent crimes, which arguably have a more detrimental impact on the community.  68% of people that are released are rearrested with a new offense.  Much of this is due to economic factors such as the inability to find a job.<sup>[43](#myfootnote43)</sup>  One third of prison re-admittance are due to parole violations<sup>[44](#myfootnote44)</sup>


From the American Bar Association, 

*Far from ensuring that individuals are afforded a meaningful right to counsel, current indigent defense systems often operate at substandard levels and provide woefully inadequate representation.  Witnesses described programs bereft of the funding and resources necessary to afford even the most basic tools essential for an effective defense.  As a result, literally thousands of accused poor persons who are unable to afford counsel routinely are denied, either entirely or in part, meaningful legal representation.  Too often when attorneys are provided, crushing workloads make it impossible for them to devote sufficient time to their cases, leading to widespread breaches of professional obligations.  To make matters worse, exceedingly modest compensation deters private attorneys from per forming more than the bare minimum required for payment.  Further, the structure of indigent defense systems often means that judges and/or state and county officials control the attorneys, thereby denying them the professional independence afforded to their prosecution counterparts and to their colleagues retained by paying clients.  Taken as whole, glaring deficiencies in indigent defense services result in a fundamentally unfair criminal justice system that constantly risks convicting persons who are genuinely innocent of the charges lodged against them.* <sup>[13](#myfootnote13)</sup> 

Justice is not colourblind. The use and sale of illegal drugs is done at remarkably consistent rates across different ethic groups; however, there are stark differences in the rate at which people are labelled a felon or sent to prison.  The number of black Americans incarcerated for drug crimes has increased more than twenty six times from 1983 to 2000, twenty two times for Latinx groups, and eight times for whites.<sup>[45](#myfootnote45)</sup> Despite this, Human Rights watch reports that this same year, white youth are much more likely to sell or possess illegal drugs and visit the emergency room for drug related visits at a rate of three times those of their black counterparts.<sup>[46](#myfootnote46)</sup> Despite evidence to the contrary, the image portrayed by the media is that drug use and sale an affliction of communities of colour.

The large numbers of people of colour labelled a felon, or subsequently imprisoned is a result of racial bias. Racial bias is applied when conducting pretext stops,  and is prevalent in the justice system.  A statistical analysis of sentencing in Georgia demonstrated that blacks were 4.3 times more likely to receive the death sentence for a murder conviction than whites who were found guilty of the same crime. <sup>[47](#myfootnote47)</sup> There is also discrimination in jury selection. It is easy for prosecutors to select all white juries.<sup>[48](#myfootnote48)</sup>

In subsequent federal administrations, being seen as "tough on crime" was considered as a precursor to a elector success. Bill Clinton passed the "Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act" which expanded the classes of crimes that would result in the death penalty, eliminated funding for higher Education for inmates, and implemented a three-strikes provision for repeat offenders.<sup>[49](#myfootnote49)</sup>  The prison population to grow and more prisons were built.


## Profit from Punishment 

To cope with the growth in prison populations, the federal government outsourced the operation of some prisons to private companies, such as Corrections Corporation of America,(CoreCivic).  Contracts for private prisons are negotiated on a per-diem basis, with a set cost per day per prisoner for healthcare, food and accommodations.  Private prisons aim to generate the highest profits possible for shareholders and company executives, a goal that is directly in opposition to providing quality care for the inhabitants. The unsurprising outcome was a reduced level of are for prisoners in private prisons, with devastating results.  The South Bend Tribune describes the case of a tort claim filed by civil rights attorney Micheal Sutherland against the Indiana Women&#x27;s prison: 

*The prisoner, Tiffany Smith, described in a letter the events that began with excruciating pain, nausea, and a large knot that emerged on the right side of her abdomen, where her skin had turned black. The 35-year-old said even guards remarked on the lack of medical response to what turned out to be a ruptured appendix.*  

*After a first emergency surgery, Smith wrote, the surgeon said her body cavity was filled with the most infection he had ever seen. After several days in an ICU, she was dismissed back to the prison infirmary with prescriptions and strict instructions about wound care, which she alleges were not followed.*

*Near death again, Smith and the tort claim allege, she was rushed back to a hospital for emergency surgery, where “the surgeon had to remove my organs, wash the infection off of them, and put them back.”*

*The tort claim describes several instances in which guards and some medical staff insisted Smith be sent to a hospital but were overruled by a doctor — for a common condition that “is also easy to diagnose if the proper steps are taken.”*
<sup>[29](#myfootnote29)</sup> 

Per profit prisons depend on more arrests, longer sentences upon conviction, and the construction of new prisons to generate revenue.  Their primary incentive is profit, not reducing the recidivism rate through educational or vocational training programs.  There are few incentives to improve the living conditions of prisoners, or to reduce the chance they will return.

In August 2016, Deputy Attorney Sally Yates released a memo indicating that the US Justice department would stop using private prisons due to reports that they do not have the same level of safety or quality as those run by the Bureau of Corrections.  The aim was to let contracts with private prisons run their course and not be renewed.<sup>[30](#myfootnote30)</sup>  Unfortunately, this directive was rescinded by the subsequent administration.

##Prison Labour

From the Atlantic article "American Slavery, Reinvented":<sup>[31](#myfootnote31)</sup>

The Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution abolished slavery and involuntary servitude.  There is one exception - as punishment for a crime.  Pprisoners can be forced to work, and paid nothing or a few pennies an hour.   

*With few exceptions, inmates are required to work if cleared by medical professionals at the prison. Punishments for refusing to do so include solitary confinement, loss of earned good time, and revocation of family visitation. For this forced labor, prisoners earn pennies per hour, if anything at all.*
<sup>[31](#myfootnote31)</sup>

Prison labour is exploited by mining and farming industries, call centers and manufacturing, all of who reap handsome profits from slave wages.  Prisoners are not protected by labour codes that protect workers on the outside.

*In the mid-1990s, Washington prisoners shrink-wrapped software and up to 20,000 Microsoft mouses for subcontractor Exmark (other reported clients: Costco and JanSport). "We don&#x27;t see this as a negative," a Microsoft spokesman said at the time. Dell used federal prisoners for PC recycling in 2003, but stopped after a watchdog group warned that it might expose inmates to toxins.*<sup>[32](#myfootnote32)</sup> 

##Women in Prison

The incarceration rate for women in the United States is 127 per 100,000 people, second only to Thailand on a global basis. As a comparison, its northern neighbour Canada incarcerates 11 per 100,000.  <sup>[35](#myfootnote35)</sup> (This is not to say that Canada doesn&#x27;t have serious issues within it&#x27;s prison systems, Indigenous people are overrepresented for similar reasons of systemic racism and stop and frisk)<sup>[38](#myfootnote38)</sup>

From a New York Times Report on Women in Prison:<sup>[30](#myfootnote30)</sup>

*The global capital for female incarceration may be right here in Oklahoma, which incarcerates 142 out of every 100,000 women, about 10 times the rate of low-ranking states like Rhode Island and Massachusetts. I wouldn’t argue that mass female incarceration is worse than mass male incarceration — they’re both counterproductive — but the imprisonment of women has heartbreaking collateral damage, because women are disproportionately likely to be primary caregivers, and 60 percent of American women in state prisons have children under 18.*

*“There’s a devastating impact on the children,” said Amy Santee of the George Kaiser Family Foundation, which supports an alternative to imprisonment for women. “They’re put in chaotic homes, they’re more likely to be sexually abused, they’re more likely to be imprisoned themselves.”* 

*Mass incarceration also has an abysmal record. Recidivism is high, and imprisonment breaks up and impoverishes families. A newly published study from the Russell Sage Foundation found that incarceration of a family member is associated with a 64 percent decline in household assets, magnifying poverty and the race gap in America. And the 2.6 million American children who have a parent in prison or jail pay an enormous price.*
<sup>[36](#myfootnote36)</sup> 

The most common reason for a woman to be incarcerated in America is drug abuse.  Until drug addiction is treated as a public health issue, rather than a moral failing worthy of long prison sentences, families will continue to have their bonds strained by separation, and children with a parent in prison will continue to be economically. (todo add quote about household assets)

##After Prison

After completng their sentences, prisoners face a new set of struggles.  A person with a felony conviction may not be be able to vote for a certain period of time or forever. The Supreme Court has upheld this restriction not violating the 14th amendment.<sup>[33](#myfootnote33)</sup>

People with a felony conviction are often unable to qualify for many types of employment, public housing, federally funded health benefits, food stamps and educational benefits, depending on the jurisdiction.  Judges are not under obligation to inform the accused that they will lose these rights if they plead out to a felony.  


Once they leave the prison, they will need a place to stay.  One of the tenants of HUD (Housing and Urban Development) One Strike guide is that if you have any convictions for any crimes, you can be denied housing.<sup>[51](#myfootnote51)</sup>  This also applies to people who stay with you in public housing.  So often people are reluctant to let relatives stay with them after they have recently left prison to mitigate the chance that they will lose their housing.  If you are charged with a minor drug crime, you can lose your housing, which may lead you to lose custody of your children to foster care because you are homeless. 

Due to all of these factors, the number of people who are homeless after leaving prison are very high. The rate of homelessness is especially acute for those people who are mentally ill. Prohibited from public health care due to laws restricting felons from registering for it, many are unable to continue the medications they need to manage their mental health issues, which further increases the probability that they will become homeless and unemployed.<sup>[37](#myfootnote37)</sup>
 

##Better outcomes

What countries serve as a model for a more humane system of incarceration?  Norway stands out as a notable example. Norway is a small country, but its approach to prisoners has been offered as a model to reduce recidivism. For example, on Norway&#x27;s Bastoy prison island prisoners apply to serve in they have five years or less of their sentence to serve.  The men live in houses, six to a house, where they share cooking and cleaning responsibilities. They are able to help with farm duties, and go swimming or fishing in their free time.  They are offered educational and vocational training, so that they may have a better chance of success when they are able to rejoin the outside world. Governor Arne Nielsen describes the prison:

*"In closed prisons we keep them locked up for some years and then let them back out, not having had any real responsibility for working or cooking. In the law, being sent to prison is nothing to do with putting you in a terrible prison to make you suffer. The punishment is that you lose your freedom. If we treat people like animals when they are in prison they are likely to behave like animals. Here we pay attention to you as human beings."*<sup>[36](#myfootnote40)</sup>

There have been also been changes in the Unites States that serve to reduce the cost and harm associated with mass incarceration.  In fact, a recent study from the Brennan Center states that 39% of America&#x27;s prison population or 576,000 people are "unnecessarily incarcerated".<sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup>  In other words, there is no public safety rationale for locking them up, and only increases the recidivism rate.  For example South Carolina, has reduced the mandatory minimums for some drug possession crimes, and instead given the offenders the option of community services, fees or fines or electronic monitoring. The result is that the recidivism rate in the state has gone down, and they have closed prisons.


##Conclusion

Mass Incarceration marginalizes predominately black, Latinx and Indigeneous people from participating fully in society.  They are predominately targeted for police for drugs despite the fact that white people consume drugs at similar rates.  97% of those charged with a felony never face a judge and jury to evaluate their case.  They enter a plea bargain to avoid the long mandatory minimum sentences associated with many crimes.  If they cannot afford a lawyer, legal services for the indigent are deeply understaffed and are unable to provide adequate services to their clients.<sup>[20](#myfootnote20)</sup> Once they have pleaded to a felony, their rights to public health care, education support, housing, welfare and voting rights may be curtailed for several years, or the rest of their life, depending on the jurisdiction.  Drug addiction is treated as a moral failure that requires a prison sentence instead of as a public health issue. Implementation of policies for harm reduction for people with substance abuse issues versus imprisonment have better outcomes for lower recidivism rates.<sup>[36](#myfootnote36)</sup> 

Some state legislatures have recently reduced sentences for drug offences. This is not due to concern for the people impacted by these harsh drug laws, but rather an attempt to reduce the large scale prison costs associated with incarcerating so many people. The impact of reduced sentences does little to improve the prospects of the people who return to their communities after being incarcerated as they still have a felony conviction and it&#x27;s economic and social consequences. 
<sup>[5](#myfootnote5)</sup>

Looking at a large scale system, we should always step back and ask "What are we optimizing this system for?". In the case of mass incarceration and the prison industrial complex, we are optimizing to shut disproportionately large numbers of people of colour behind bars, with few rights or supports to allow them to succeed after release, all while large corporations profit from cheap labour and increasing numbers of private prisons.
